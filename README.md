# 🔐 Day 4: Random Password Generator – 30 Days of JavaScript

This is Day 4 of my 30 Days of JavaScript challenge as part of the HexCode Internship. I created a functional and customizable password generator using vanilla JavaScript.

## 📌 Description

This app generates strong random passwords based on user preferences like length and character types. It’s simple, responsive, and allows users to copy passwords to their clipboard with a single click.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:
- JavaScript conditionals
- Handling form inputs
- DOM events
- Using `Math.random()` for randomization

## 🚀 Features

- 🧮 Set custom password length (between 4 and 32)
- 🔠 Toggle options: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
